This is a example of using [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io) to mock a GraphQL API in a React application.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server with mocking enabled:

```bash
API_MOCKING=enabled npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The mocking is defined in `mocks/handlers.js`
